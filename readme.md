# BN3 Plus

## Introduction

This patch intends to fix some pet peeves I had with Battle Network 3. It will
put back the Jack In and NaviCust animations that Capcom USA removed (presumably
to save cartridge space, as putting them back in extends the ROM size beyond
8 MB even though the animations are compressed). It also lets you decompress
NaviCust programs and it restores the original internet color once you've taken
down the final boss of the main story.

## How to use

Apply to a clean North American Battle Network 3 ROM either "White US.ips" or
"Blue US.ips" depending on your game version, using your favorite IPS patching
tool. If you don't know any, try Lunar IPS. I haven't tested the European so I
don't know if it will work on those (I assume not).

Please note that applying this patch will make the ROM bigger than 8 MB.

## Features

- Adds the Jack In and NaviCust animations back in from the Japanese versions.
- Lets you "decompress" NaviCust programs by re-entering their compression code.
- Restores the original internet color when you've beaten the final boss.
